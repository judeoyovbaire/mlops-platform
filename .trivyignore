# =============================================================================
# FIXED ISSUES (kept for reference)
# =============================================================================
# The following issues have been addressed in the codebase:
# - AVD-AWS-0104: EKS public endpoint now has CIDR restrictions via cluster_endpoint_public_access_cidrs
# - AVD-AWS-0057: VPC Flow Logs enabled via enable_vpc_flow_logs variable
# - AVD-AZURE-0017: Key Vault network ACL now defaults to Deny with VNet access
# - AVD-AZURE-0013: AKS API server now supports authorized_ip_ranges
# - AVD-AWS-0031: ECR image tags now set to IMMUTABLE
# - Security group egress restricted to VPC CIDR for RDS

# =============================================================================
# Kubernetes manifest warnings - intentional for ML workloads
# =============================================================================
# KSV001: Process can elevate privileges - needed for GPU workloads
# KSV003: Default capabilities not dropped - handled by PodSecurityPolicy
# KSV012: Runs as root - some ML frameworks require this
# KSV014: Root filesystem not read-only - ML models need write access
# KSV021: Low user/group ID - acceptable for internal services

# =============================================================================
# External module warnings (terraform-aws-modules)
# =============================================================================
# These are from upstream Terraform registry modules and are configured
# via module inputs where possible. The following are accepted risks:
# - terraform-aws-modules/eks: Public endpoint access controlled via our variables
# - terraform-aws-modules/vpc: NAT Gateway egress is required for outbound traffic

# =============================================================================
# Development environment accepted risks
# =============================================================================
# The following are acceptable for dev environments but should be
# reviewed for production deployments:
# - S3 using AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3) instead of CMK - enable via enable_kms_encryption=true
# - RDS deletion protection disabled - enable via mlflow_db_deletion_protection=true
